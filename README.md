This repository contains the source code for my personal website portfolio.  The website provides an overview of the various projects I've worked on.

## Technologies
 - HTML
 - CSS
 - Javacsript 
 - React
 - Vite

 ## Prerequisites

 To build and run this project, you need to have the following installed on your machine:
  - Nodejs
  - npm
  - Vite

## Repository Structure
1. `src` - The source code for the website, including all React components.
2. `public` - Static assets, such as images and fonts for website metadata.
3. `vite.config.js` - The Vite configuration file.
4. `package.json` - Project metadata and dependencies.
5. `README.md` - This file, containing information about the project and instructions for setting up the development environment.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository 
```sh
git clone https://github.com/pajsimbulan/webportfolio.git
```

2. Change into the project directory:
```sh
cd webportfolio
```

3. Install the project dependencies:
```sh
npm install
```

4. Start the development server:
```sh
npm run dev

## Deployment
To create a production build of the website, run:
